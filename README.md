# Agoric node installation 

First of all, I'm really happy to be invited into Agoric's testnet, this is already a great experience considering clear organization and documentation.

As for the the first task - node installation, everything went smoothly and straighforward, no sudden errors, no problems with libraries, nothing.

It would be great if it was mentioned somewhere that coins from the faucet will appear on your balance only after the node is fully synced.

Also I've tryed to install it both ways - with one-liner from nodes guru and with all "manual" steps, both worked perfectly fine.
